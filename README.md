### Control configuration and inputs
Driver can emulate HTC Vive controllers and Valve Index controllers with skeletal animation and work in desktop and HMD orientations. It's adjusted by editing `settings.xml` in `resources` folder.  
There are more configurable restrictions, such as global input, trackpad, trigger, grip and etc. Check [wiki page](../../wiki/Offset-settings) for few offset settings reported from users.
